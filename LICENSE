CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Weakly Reciprocal

Preamble

CERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among
hardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the
freedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs
and products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open
Hardware Licence comes in three variants: CERN-OHL-P (permissive); and
two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly reciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S
(strongly reciprocal).

The CERN-OHL-W is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in
unmodified form only.

Use of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any
Licensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in
their development.

1 Definitions

  1.1 'Licence' means this CERN-OHL-W.

  1.2 'Compatible Licence' means

       a) any earlier version of the CERN Open Hardware licence, or

       b) any version of the CERN-OHL-S or the CERN-OHL-W, or

       c) any licence which permits You to treat the Source to which
          it applies as licensed under CERN-OHL-S or CERN-OHL-W
          provided that on Conveyance of any Associated Source, or
          any Available Component, to which that licence applies You
          satisfy any applicable requirements of this Licence.

  1.3 'Source' means information such as design materials or digital
      code which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to
      prepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its
      medium or how it is expressed. It may include Notices.

  1.4 'Covered Source' means Source that is explicitly made available
      under this Licence.

  1.5 'Product' means any device, component, work or physical object,
      whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,
      application or processing of Covered Source.

  1.6 'Make' means to create or configure something, whether by
      manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered
      Source or another Product or otherwise.

  1.7 'Available Component' means any part, sub-assembly, library or
      code which:

       a) is licensed to You as Complete Source under a Compatible
          Licence; or

       b) is a "work of the interface" or a "system library" as those
          terms are defined in version 3 of the GNU General Public
          Licence.

  1.8 'External Material' means anything (including Source) which:

       a) is only combined with Covered Source in a way that
          interfaces with it using a documented interface specified
          in the Covered Source; and

       b) is not a derivative of or does not include Covered Source,
          or, if it does, it is solely to the extent necessary to
          facilitate such interfacing.

  1.9 'Complete Source' means the set of all Source necessary to Make
      a Product, in the preferred form for making modifications,
      including necessary installation and interfacing information
      both for the Product, and for any included Available Components.
      Complete Source need not include the Source of any Available
      Component, provided that You include in the Complete Source
      sufficient information to enable a recipient to Make or source
      and use any Available Components to Make the Product.

  1.10 'Source Location' means a location where a Licensor has placed
       Covered Source, and which that Licensor reasonably believes
       will remain easily accessible for at least three years for
       anyone to obtain a digital copy.

  1.11 'Notice' means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,
       Source Location references, modification notices (subsection
       3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the
       disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered
       Source.

  1.12 'Licensor' means any person who creates or modifies Covered
       Source. A Licensor may also be a Licensee.

  1.13 'Licensee' or 'You' means any person exercising rights under
       this Licence.

  1.14 'Convey' means to communicate or transfer.

2 Applicability

  2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying
      of Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By
      exercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably
      accept these terms and conditions.

  2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and
      shall apply worldwide and without limitation in time.

  2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the
      rights granted under this Licence to other Licensees.

  2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing,
      or any other similar right.

3 Copying, Modifying and Conveying Covered Source

  3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in
      any medium, provided You retain all Notices.

  3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices, provided
      that You irrevocably undertake to make that modified Source
      available from a Source Location should You Convey a Product in
      circumstances where the recipient does not otherwise receive a
      copy of the modified Covered Source. In each case subsection 3.3
      shall apply.

      You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to
      the corresponding portion of the Covered Source (for example,
      a notice which is no longer applicable to that portion of the
      Covered Source because it has been removed or transferred) and
      a modified Notice may only differ to the extent necessary to
      reflect the new name, contact details or URL.

  3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You
      shall also become a Licensor) provided that You:

       a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2;

       b) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You
          have modified it, with the date and brief description of how
          You have modified it;

       c) add a Source Location Notice for the modified Covered Source
          if You Convey in circumstances where the recipient does not
          otherwise receive a copy of the modified Covered Source; and

       d) license the modified Covered Source under this Licence, or
          under a Compatible Licence.

4 Making and Conveying Products

You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either
provide each recipient of a Product with a copy of the Complete Source
in a machine-readable form, or make the Complete Source available from
a Source Location. Note that this subsection does not apply to a
Product that incorporates an Available Component, but does apply to
the Covered Source of that Available Component.

5 Research and Development

You may Convey Covered Source or Products to a consultancy,
manufacturer or other organisation for the purpose of that organisation
undertaking development, testing or manufacturing activities on Your
behalf. Provided that You ensure that such organisation irrevocably
undertakes to:

  a) comply with this Licence in respect of all activities undertaken
     on Your behalf;

  b) make all resulting Source available under this Licence (or a
     Compatible Licence); and

  c) not Convey the Source or Products to any third party other than
     in accordance with section 4.

6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY

  6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY -- The Covered Source and any Products
      are provided 'as is' and any express or implied warranties,
      including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
      merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of
      third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use
      are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the
      maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no
      representation that any Source or Product does not or will not
      infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other
      proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and
      performance of any Source or Product is with You and not the
      Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of
      this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted
      under this Licence.

  6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY -- The Licensor shall, to
      the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for
      direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,
      punitive or other damages of any character including, without
      limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of
      use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused
      and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including
      negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way
      in connection with the Covered Source, modified Covered Source
      and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of
      the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the
      Licensor(s) harmless against all liability, costs, damages,
      losses and expenses, including legal expenses in respect of any
      third party claim, arising in any way out of the use of the
      Covered Source in connection with this Licence.

7 Patents

  7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each
      Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
      non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
      stated in subsections 7.2 and 7.3) patent licence to Make, have
      Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
      the Covered Source and Products, where such licence applies only
      to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are
      necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered
      Source as Covered Source.

  7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
      a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
      Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory
      patent infringement, then any patent licences granted to You
      under this Licence for the Covered Source shall terminate as of
      the date such litigation is filed.

  7.3 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including
      a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
      Making of any Product in accordance with designs sourced from a
      Licensor constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
      then any patent licences granted to You under this Licence for
      that Product shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
      filed.

8 General

  8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become
      invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this shall not
      affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole,
      provided that the provisions held invalid or unenforceable are
      not material to the overall functioning of the Licence.

  8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and
      abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is
      known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where
      the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall
      be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of
      endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or its
      personnel.

  8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence
      which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may
      differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New
      versions will be published with a unique version number and a
      variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has
      specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source
      without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source
      as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that
      variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be
      treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may
      also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific
      version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You
      may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same
      variant, or, if no variant is specified, CERN-OHL-S.

  8.4 This Licence shall not be construed as excluding or limiting any
      implicit licence or other defences to infringement that may
      otherwise be available to You under applicable law.
