# Multiduino Core

This folder contains the Multiduino Arduino core — a custom board support package for the Multiduino v2, designed for use with the Arduino IDE.

## What This Is

The Multiduino core provides:

- Board definition and pin mapping for the ATmega328PB on the Multiduino v2
- Custom libraries for all on-board peripherals (RTC, FRAM, SRAM, EEPROM, SHT4x, microSD)
- Hardware-aware configuration not available through generic Arduino libraries

## Installation

Installation instructions will be added here once the core is ready for release.

## Compatibility

All standard Arduino sketches remain compatible when using this core. The Multiduino core is a superset of the Arduino Uno environment.
